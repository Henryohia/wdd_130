            Hi everyone, my name is Henry and I am from Lagos Nigeria. I am single and open to making new friends, I love play 8 ball pool,
            love to go for recreational activities. I emjoy being at the beach it makes me relaxed, I enjoy listening to music and 
            watching movies to ease stress. I am a purpose-driven person, open to learning new things and constantly looking for 
            opportunities to improve myself.   
        </p>
        <p>
            I am taking web and computer programming as my first certificate in BYU-Idaho which is a big one for me and 
            I hope to become a profficient developer at the end of my degree and be able to solve real world problems. 
            I have a strong passion for coding as much as I am still in the learning process I sometimes wish I am a 
            pro already, lol. I am so happy for the opportunity to get an education even with BYU-Idaho, I feel its a blessing. 
        </p>
