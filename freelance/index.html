              <p>
                Whether that was your original intention in coming to the site or not,
                we entertain people in some ways that they will more likely retain our
                information better, request our service or want to be part of what we
                are offering.

              <p>
                We know a lot of us want to be part of something and stand for something
                bigger than what we are. That could involve being a paid technician, or
                someone “in the know”, or even just being part of the group that has
                purchased or serviced from us.
