      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My goal is to create a website that will give my audience an awareness of my job skills and profession. 
        Imagine people checking my skills out in a webpage that shows them everything that I do practice. 
        What will they think of my proficiency and brand? will they rate me? does my line of network expand? 
        I will create and design my website to look so visually appealing that people can navigate smoothly 
        to see what I can offer with my skills and profession.</p>  <!-- change this -->
